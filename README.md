# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

##Cookie Clicker:

1. CSS(media responsive)
2. dynamically update the result
3. using local storage to save user data
4. there is more CSS( animation ) for bigger screen size (900px and above)
5. this app is also usable for people with disabilities

I would love my app growth in so many aspects(having login page, userDash board, admin dashbard,database to save information of users or game)

### the thing that I loved abiut react comparing javaScript , it it more manageable , and using local storage here was so much eaier comparing the JS, because the only thing that is needed is adding item from main variable of each useState hook into localStorage and get items from localstorage and use them in relatd useState Function. but some dev tools checking was so annoying to manage and control, and the envoirtment is still confusing but understandable.

### I would like to use APIs for my games but I needed some changes as well in that info from web API which was against my plan for the game for this reason I didn't use API for getting data Also the price of the API was too high for testing code

### to be honest the code that I have written , was not that simple to write it immediate , I wrote most of the buy testing if that way of coding is ok or not, I wasn't confident as I wrote the codes in JS Vanilla. but I like React more , and in week ahead which is about more React , I will gain more confident and experience.
